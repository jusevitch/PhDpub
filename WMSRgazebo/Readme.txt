The files in this directory are the MATLAB files required to run a demonstration of the WMSR algorithm in a Gazebo environment.

Please note that a directory location must be changed in the file "WMSRGazebo_1_0.m" for it to work
properly. Specifically, the value of the variable "file" must be changed both on line 87 and 136. Line 87 should be the
location of your Gazebo launch files, and line 136 should be the location of the vel_input.txt file containing the velocity
commands.

THESE FILES MAY NOT BE MAINTAINED. The simulation was still under construction as of 1/8/18. Feel free to email James Usevitch 
at usevitch [*at*] umich [*dot*] edu if you have any questions.
